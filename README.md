# Machine Learning Based Detection and Characterisation of Magnetopause Crossings in the Lunar Distance Magnetotail
This repository contains the research, code, and datasets for the TU Delft's master thesis: "Machine Learning Based Detection and Characterisation of Magnetopause Crossings in the Lunar Distance Magnetotail". The project explores machine learning techniques to classify and predict the magnetotail boundary based on ARTEMIS data, aiming to improve accuracy in space weather research. 
## Demos 
Two demos exist, showcasing the usage of the developed models and pipeline.
